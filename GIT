SETUP GIT ENVIRONMENT
DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL GIT
There are online materials that are better than any that I could
provide
Standard one: http://git-scm.com/downloads
Hereâ€™s one from StackExchange:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/315911/git-for-beginners-the-definitive
-practical-guide#323764
Install Git on your machine from http://git-scm.com/downloads
Accept context menu items
Git access:
Right click from windows explorer gitBash to enter commands

INTRODUCE YOURSELF TO GIT
Start git / gitBash

Enter these lines (with appropriate changes):

git config --global user.name "John Smith"

git config --global user.email jsmith@seas.upenn.edu

You only need to do this once

If you want to use a different name/email address for a
particular project, you can change it for just that project

cd to the project directory

Use the above commands, but leave out the --global
